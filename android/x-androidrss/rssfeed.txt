      to protect against these assaults. Adding a CAPTCHA to your site will steer away most computer 
      automated browsing in sections of your site you want to protect, such as user registration or  
      tell-a-friend emailing. This tutorial describes how to integrate two CAPTCHA solutions into your existing 
      WebSphere Commerce application to protect your Web site against computer automated attacks.]]></description>

      share browser-independent bookmarks, accessible directly over the Internet, in ways
      your browser won't allow. The traditional hierarchical organization of browser bookmarks is overhauled, allowing users to instead associate each and every bookmark with any number of descriptive tags. Imagine a single page where you and your friends can surf the Web and have your del.icio.us tags, links, and functions handy, or a single page where you can save the site you're browsing directly into your del.icio.us account, along with comments and chosen tags. This tutorial shows you how to use Ajax to build just such a page using a PHP script as the server-side proxy.]]></description>

	               <description><![CDATA[   Performance optimization of code is serious business. It's fairly common to see a 
    piece of functionally correct software written in C or C++ that takes way 
    too much memory, time, or, in the worst case, both. As a developer, one of the most 
    powerful tools that C/C++ arms you with to improve processing time and prevent 
    memory corruption is the control over how memory is allocated or deallocated in your 
    code. This tutorial demystifies memory management concepts by telling you how to 
    create your very own memory manager for specific situations. ]]></description>

      two different types of Web services clients -- a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
      (Java EE) client and a stand-alone Java client -- and handled user-defined
      exceptions in Web services. This second installment in the three-part series shows

  unfamiliar development language or hiring costly  developers. What if there was a way to
  create an executable business  process using a graphical editor that can ultimately be
  executed on an  appropriate engine? Well, there is. Using the Eclipse STP BPMN Modeler,
  you can graphically create a  business model represented in XML that can be converted to

Learn how to use Asynchronous JavaScript + XML (Ajax) to download XML data from a Web server, and discover how you can use Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to transform it dynamically into Firefox user-interface elements expressed in XML User Interface Language (XUL).
